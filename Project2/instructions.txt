-- HOW TO PLAY MASTERMIND --

There are four board spaces. Each space has a secret 
letter assigned to it. The player is to figure out the
order in which those letters are assigned to the spaces
on the board. The player is only limited to guessing
four DIFFERENT letters at a time. 

On Easy, Intermediate, and Hard mode, the game will tell 
you when you picked  a letter that exists on the board 
with a lowercase 'o'. If you picked a letter that exists on the
board AND got the exact spot correct, the game will tell
you with a capital 'O'. However, it will not tell you what 
order. 

BEGINNER moder is reccomended for players new to the game.
In that mode, there are only 4 possible letters, and it
will tell you the exact spots that you got right.
